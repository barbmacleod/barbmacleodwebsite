          <p>I love to create.  I love learning.  I love a challenge.  I love new things and change.  I love people.  I love kayaking, hiking, and skiing.  I love to sew.  I love beautiful things.  And I really, really ... love my family!.</p>

          <p>
I've always been pretty crafty but didn't try my hand at painting until later in life.  As a young person I started off in business.  Right out of school I became an entrepreneur and that has never changed.  Over the years I've owned an educational toy store (Whipper Snapper Inc.), a specialty food store (The Uncommon Grocer) and a mystery shopping business (Retail Success Inc.).  I also did contract work in the agricultural and culinary fields.  Then I began to paint.  I loved it so I did what I do best and turned it into a business!  I started painting scenes from my home town, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.  Some of my paintings seemed like they would be so nice on market bags.  I looked into it and found a company that could transfer my painted images onto reusable <a href="marketbags.html">Market Bags</a>. I started going to little markets in the summer and selling my bags to tourists and Islanders. They were a hit!  Now I also have this website which I hope will enable me to connect with many more people. I feel very grateful for the paths I've been able to explore. Who knows whats next!

<h4>Even More About Me!</h4>
      <p>I couldn't resist this big empty wall in my art room.  What better to fill this space than a mural.  I chose a PEI Landscape in muted colors to match the feeling of the room.  If you are interested in painting one of your walls with a mural please <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a></p>

      <p>Thanks to the wonderfully adventureous Tracy Crosby for helping me with all my photograph needs. Things would be rather dull without her!</p>
