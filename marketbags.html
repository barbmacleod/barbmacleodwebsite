     <p>A few years ago on a very snowy day in February I had an idea to put the image of my paintings on a market bag.  The result was these reuable and durable bags.Washable, spacious and functional they were a great improvment on the curious assortment of bags I had been using.  As an extra benefit they were images of the places
       I love and know on PEI.  How nice to be carrying around images that are culturally important to me as opposed to displaying someones corporate logo.</p>
